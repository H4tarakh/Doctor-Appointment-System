      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>  
            D-SLOT aka The Doctor Appointment System is a user-friendly platform that allows patients to easily connect with doctors and schedule appointments for their treatment. Patients can browse through a list of available doctors, view their specialties, and select a suitable time slot for their appointment.
      </p>   
      <p> 
            Once the patient selects a doctor and a time slot, they are prompted to fill out a simple registration form. The registration form collects basic information such as the patient's name, age, contact details, any queries or suggestions they may have, and their blood group.
      </p>

      <p> 
            After filling out the registration form, the patient can confirm their appointment. The system then processes the information provided and registers the patient for the selected appointment slot. If the registration is successful, the patient receives a confirmation message indicating that their appointment has been successfully booked.
      </p>
       <p> 
            Overall, the Doctor Appointment System simplifies the process of scheduling appointments, allowing patients to conveniently connect with doctors and receive the care they need.
