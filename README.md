This project aims to create a platform for connecting doctors and patients efficiently.
         Doctors can register their details, including their name, consultation fees, hospital, and available time slots. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Patients, on the other hand, can view the list of available doctors and their respective day and time slots for the day. 
        They can then select a doctor based on their preferred time slot and book an appointment using a booking form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, patients can also order medicines through the platform, making it a comprehensive solution for both medical consultations and medication needs. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Overall, the platform streamlines the process of scheduling appointments and ordering medicines, enhancing the experience for both doctors and patients.
